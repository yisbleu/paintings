      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my studio. I’m a contemporary painter exploring emotion,
        movement, and atmosphere through abstract and expressive compositions.
        Each piece invites viewers to reflect and connect beyond words.
      </p>
      <p>
        My process begins with intuition — letting color and texture guide me.
        The resulting works balance chaos and calm, spontaneity and structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        My art has been featured in local and international exhibitions and
        is held in private collections around the world.
