      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my studio. I’m a contemporary painter whose work explores emotion,
        movement, and atmosphere through abstract and expressive compositions.
        Each piece is an invitation to pause, reflect, and connect with a feeling beyond words.
      </p>
      <p>
        My creative process begins with intuition — I let color and texture guide me.
        The resulting works balance chaos and calm, spontaneity and structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve exhibited in both local and international art spaces, and my paintings
        are held in private collections worldwide.
